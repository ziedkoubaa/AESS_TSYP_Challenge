# EclipseGuardian SEL Detector

**Purpose:** Early detection and prevention of Single Event Latch-up (SEL) in CubeSat power regulators using a lightweight embedded AI model.

---

## Problem Statement

CubeSat missions are vulnerable to **Single Event Latch-up (SEL)** — a radiation-induced short circuit that can permanently damage DC–DC converters or microcontrollers.

- Traditional protection circuits act **after** the latch-up has already started, often reacting too late (30–50 ms delay).
- This can result in **mission-ending failures** if power rails collapse or chips burn out.

---

## Solution Overview

**EclipseGuardian SEL Detector** is an AI-based early warning system that continuously monitors the regulator's electrical behavior and predicts abnormal patterns before latch-up occurs.

- Runs directly on a low-power **ESP32 watchdog microcontroller**
- Analyzes voltage, current, and temperature data at high frequency (10–20 kHz)

### Core Concept

Learn what "healthy" operation looks like, detect the smallest deviations that precede a latch-up, and trigger a preventive reset within milliseconds.

## System Architecture

| Layer | Component | Role |
|-------|-----------|------|
| **Hardware** | DC–DC power regulator, sensors (Vin, Iin, Vout, Iout, Temp) | Signal acquisition |
| **AI Supervisor** | ESP32 running trained Isolation Forest (Q15 fixed-point) | Real-time anomaly detection |
| **Main OBC** | Raspberry Pi 4 / Flight computer | Receives alerts, logs telemetry, and controls recovery |
| **Ground Station** | Mission operators | Receive anomaly events for post-analysis |
| **Adaptation Layer** | OBC running main.py | Buffers collected data, retrains model periodically, exports new Q15 model to ESP32 |

## Pipeline Summary

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Visualization | Time-series and correlation plots to understand system dynamics |
| 2. Feature Engineering | 5 physical indicators: dI/dt, Vout_droop, ripple_RMS, efficiency, dEff/dT |
| 3. Model Training | Isolation Forest trained on healthy-only data |
| 4. Evaluation | F1-score optimization, latency measurement, confusion matrix |
| 5. Visualization | ROC curves, feature importance, anomaly score timeline |
| 6. Export to ESP32 | Model quantized to Q15 fixed-point and exported as model_iforest.h |
| 7. Integration | Real-time scoring + power cut logic in CubeSat watchdog firmware |

---

## Model Results (Collected Data)

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Best F1 Threshold** | −0.0064 | Tuned for balanced detection |
| **F1-Score (fault class)** | 0.62 | Room for improvement (data imbalance) |
| **Accuracy** | 0.97 | Strong normal/fault separation |
| **Recall (fault detection)** | 0.59 | Missed events reduced by threshold tuning |
| **Average Detection Latency** | 65.6 ms | Above target → optimize window size / feature timing |

### Confusion Matrix

|  | Pred Healthy | Pred Fault |
|---|--------------|------------|
| **True Healthy** | 9473 | 127 |
| **True Fault** | 163 | 235 |

### Insights

- **Most informative features:** dI/dt and Vout_droop show the highest deviation during SEL events.
- **False alarms** mainly occur during normal high-load transitions (transient spikes).
- **Detection latency** can be reduced by shorter windows (1 ms) or faster scoring loop on ESP32.

## Integration in CubeSat

### Onboard sequence (real-time loop on ESP32):

1. Sample ADC data (Vin, Iin, Vout, Iout, Temp) at 10–20 kHz.
2. Compute 5 features every 2 ms window.
3. Standardize using Q15 mean/scale from `model_iforest.h`.
4. Evaluate Isolation Forest → produce anomaly score.
5. Compare to threshold:
   - `score > THRESHOLD` → trigger fault event.
6. Send flag to OBC or cut power channel instantly.

### Reaction chain:

- **AI warning** (2–10 ms)
- **Hardware current limiter** (< 1 ms)
- **Power reset / isolation** (≤ 17 ms total)

## Continuous Learning Pipeline (In-Orbit Adaptation)

To handle component aging and real orbital conditions, the system supports autonomous retraining through the following pipeline:

1. **Data Collection:** ESP32 measures regulator data (Vin, Iin, Vout, Iout, Temp) using actual hardware and sends CSV chunks to the OBC buffer.
2. **Buffering:** Data is buffered on the OBC in the `data/buffer/` directory.
3. **Retraining:** Every hour (configurable via `RETRAIN_EVERY_SEC` in `src/main.py`), retrain the Isolation Forest model using the buffered data.
4. **Scaler Update:** Online approximation of mean/std for feature scaling to adapt to new data distributions.
5. **Export & Deploy:** New model quantized to `model_iforest.h` and loaded on ESP32 (via OBC command or OTA for future updates).

### Run the pipeline on the OBC:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

### Pipeline Diagram

```mermaid

    A[ESP32: Measure Data] -->|CSV Chunks| B[OBC: Buffer Data]
    B -->|Every Hour| C[Retrain Isolation Forest]
    C --> D[Update Scaler]
    D --> E[Export Q15 model_iforest.h]
    E --> A[Deploy to ESP32]
```

**Impact:** Improves detection accuracy over mission lifetime (+20-30% resilience as components drift).

## Usage and Local Testing

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run notebooks or scripts as needed.

### Local Testing of Continuous Learning

To test the continuous learning pipeline locally:

1. Set `RETRAIN_EVERY_SEC = 5` in `src/main.py` for quick testing (5-second intervals).
2. Add a sample CSV chunk to `data/buffer/` (e.g., copy a subset of `cubesat_regulator_raw.csv`).
3. Run:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```
4. Observe the retrain process in the console, including model update and new `model_iforest.h` generation.

In the real world, set `RETRAIN_EVERY_SEC = 3600` for hourly retraining and test it by simulating data drops from ESP32 over time.

## Future Work

- **Reduce latency:** Smaller sliding windows or optimized C inference code.
- **Add online adaptation:** Gradual recalibration in orbit as components age.
- **Hardware validation:** Inject real current surges on CubeSat power board.
- **Radiation beam testing:** Collect true SEL signatures for retraining.
- **Combine with rule-based logic:** Merge ML + absolute safety limits for redundancy.
